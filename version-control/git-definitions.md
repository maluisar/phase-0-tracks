# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? It is a tool that helps us track and back up our work
* What is a branch and why would you use one? It is a line of saved points and we use it to add code without risking all the previous work
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a save point and a good commit message should be very descriptive of the changes that the save point includes
* What is a merge conflict? When both of the branches you want to merge have changed and it isn't clear the changes in what branch should be considered

1. Do some googling about what is jquery and what are sthe most important concepts. Look for a cheat sheet.
2. Find some short courses on jquery and see the apendix.
3. From those sources select the most important topics to research.
4. Research each topic.


Googling I found a short course on youtube that included the most important things already explained in the same place, so I didn't have to do all the research on my own.
